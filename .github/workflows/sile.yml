    # Danger alert! This partial upgrade scenario is explicitly *not* supported
    # by Arch Linux and *will* break at some point as the container ages. It
    # isn't needed when testing soon after a SILE release, and eventually will
    # stop working when any libraries SILE depends on get bumped. But it does
    # work to extend the life of the CI matrix between those two extreemes.
